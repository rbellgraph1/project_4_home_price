Secondary

### *Testing Changes and Outcomes**
Changed to normalized. 
Training features with 3 layers and we are about $35K veriance. <br>Using all as relu 25,25,12 layers <br>
Down to 2 layers and changed to $65K variance. <br>
Using LeakReLU as the second layer with 50 and 50 gave us about 45K and  changed back to 25 and 25 with and ended with 65k <br>
Using  all 3 leaky with output parametersas leaky  25,25 and 12 layers- output of 60k <br>
leaky leaky <br>
120, 120, 60  Relu, Leaky, leaky, Relu $22k <br>
